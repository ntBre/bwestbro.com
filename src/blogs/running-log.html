A Running Log in Org Mode
</p>

<p>
Org-mode and its tables were some of the major factors drawing me to Emacs in the first place, 
so as I began running again, I decided that it would be interesting to make my running log in 
org-mode. I began by including my Plan, taken from <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/base-training/novice-base-training/">Hal Higdon's Novice Base Training</a> as a fairly
simple table, but already I had a chance to learn my first piece of org tables as I tried to get
the week number to automatically populate. As you can see in the source code below, I used the 
<code>tblfm</code> directive to fill the first column with an ascending counter based on the advice of 
<a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/14681/org-mode-table-row-number-grow-automatically">this StackExchange thread</a>. The rest I filled in manually, taking advantage of evil-mode visual
selection to take care of most of the replicate work.

Once this was finished, I started working on the more interesting problem of creating a useful
running log. My first draft was pretty lame, following the pattern of the plan table and not 
calculating anything besides a weekly distance total as seen below. Here I actually wrote my first
formula, again using <code>tblfm</code> and this time telling org to make the 9th column equal to the sum of 
columns 2 through 8. I also learned how to actually refresh the formula by pressing C-c C-c on the 
formula itself rather than anywhere in the table.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">|------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------|
| Week | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun | Total |
|------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------|
|    1 | 0.0 |     |     |     |     |     |     |    0. |
|------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------|
#+tblfm: $9=vsum($2..$8)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, this wasn't really all I wanted out of my running log. Intead I wanted it at least to include 
my time in addition to distance and to use the two to calculate my pace. I'm not sure I went with the 
ideal table layout for this but once I got something passable I moved ahead with the real challenge, 
which was doing the pace calculations. As it turns out, this was only a real challenge because I made
a dumb mistake somewhere, and everything was quite easy as shown below. I just had to divide the time
by the distance and use the <code>;T</code> command at the end to convert back to a time.

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">|------+-----+----------+----------+----------+-------+-------|
| Week | Day | Distance |     Time |     Pace | Route | Notes |
|------+-----+----------+----------+----------+-------+-------|
|    1 | Mon |     5.00 | 00:22:10 | 00:04:26 |       |       |
|------+-----+----------+----------+----------+-------+-------|
#+tblfm: $5=$4/$3<span style="color: #73d216;">;</span><span style="color: #73d216;">T</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Additionally, I was concerned that some of my routes or notes might be longer than the line, so upon 
a quick search I found <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38135/wrap-cell-content-in-an-org-mode-table">this thread</a> that describes converting to a table.el table instead of the default
org-table, which may come in handy in the future. Another interesting idea for the future will be 
plotting my data with Org Plot, but I have not yet implemented this feature.
