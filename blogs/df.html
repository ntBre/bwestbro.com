  This is the text version of a presentation I prepared on density
  fitting approximations for a graduate class in quantum
  chemistry. Hopefully it can offer some background on these
  approximations and on some of the history of quantum chemistry in
  general. If you notice any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
At a very high level, density fitting (DF) is an approximation
technique for speeding up calculations at several points by reducing
three- and four-center integrals to linear combinations of one- and
two-center integrals, enabling the reuse of these intermediate
computations with (theoretically) little reduction in
accuracy. While its applications have been broadened in recent
years, the history of DF begins with computing the integral
components of the electronic Hamiltonian, so that's where we will
start our discussion as well.
</p>

<p>
The five parts of the electronic Hamiltonian are the electron
kinetic energy, electron-electron repulsion, electron-nuclear
attraction, nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and nuclear kinetic energy,
as shown in the equation below.
</p>

\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \hat{T}_{e} + \hat{V}_{ee} + \hat{V}_{eN} + \hat{V}_{NN} + \hat{T}_{N}
\end{equation}

<p>
Under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_approximation">Born-Oppenheimer</a> approximation, we can treat the nuclear
kinetic energy as zero and reduce our Hamiltonian to four
terms. Further, given the stationary nuclei under this
approximation, we can also reduce the nuclear-nuclear repulsion term
to a constant, leaving only three terms actually requiring
integration of our wavefunction. The nuclear repulsion energy is
given by the constant expression
</p>

\begin{equation}
\hat{V}_{NN} = \sum_{A > B} \frac{Z_AZ_B}{R_{AB}}
\end{equation}

<p>
where Z represents the nuclear charge, and \(R_{AB}\) is the
distance between nuclei A and B. The remaining integral terms are
given by the following
</p>

\begin{align}
\hat{T}_e + \hat{V}_{eN} + \hat{V}_{ee} =
&\int\phi_\mu^*(r)\big(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_r^2\big)\phi_\nu(r)dr\\
+ &\int\phi_\mu^*(r)\big(-\sum_A^N \frac{Z}{r_A}\big)\phi_\nu(r)dr
+ \int\phi_\mu^*(r_1)\phi_\nu(r_1)\frac{1}{r_{12}}\phi_\lambda^*(r_2)\phi_\sigma(r_2)
\end{align}

<p>
Of these terms, the first two are one-electron terms since the
operators depend on the coordinates of a single electron. As such,
these are relatively cheap to compute. On the other hand, the third
term represents a two-electron integral because the operator
\(\frac{1}{r_{12}}\) depends on the coordinates of electrons 1
and 2. This introduces a total of four subscripts into the equation,
\(\mu\), \(\nu\), \(\lambda\), and \(\sigma\), in contrast to the
two subscripts in the one-electron integrals. In turn, this means
that the computational scaling of these integrals will be
\(\mathcal{O}(N^4)\), again compared to the \(\mathcal{O}(N^2)\) of
the one-electron integrals. While this scaling is not that bad
compared to parts of higher levels of theory like MP2 and CCSD, it
is much more expensive than the one-electron integrals, making the
two-electron integral computations the most expensive portion of the
HF procedure.
</p>

<p>
As touched on above, more important than the number of electrons
involved is the number of centers, which is directly tied to the
number of subscripts. The kinetic energy term will always be
constrained to either one or two centers/subscripts because only two
orbitals are involved in the calculation. The nuclear attraction
term can involve up to three centers, making the integral somewhat
more difficult, because of the presence of two orbitals,
\(\phi_\mu\) and \(\phi_\nu\), and a nucleus. Finally, the electron
repulsion integrals can involve up to four centers, all of which are
orbitals.
</p>

<p>
Again, this was the original problem that DF sought to solve. Rather
than computing these three- and four-centered integrals directly, DF
methods approximate them by generating a function of some density
and then optimizing, or fitting, the function to minimize the error
with respect to some error measurement. This reduces three- and
four-centered problems to linear combinations of one- and
two-centered problems, which are easier to compute and now reusable,
reducing the overall computational cost.

<h2 id="org63e3718"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Early development</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
While DF is still an important avenue for speeding calculations
today, a couple of factors made it invaluable at the advent of
computational chemistry. The first of these was the use of Slater
type orbitals (STOs) in early chemistry software. STOs are close
approximate solutions of the Schrödinger equation and as such were a
clear choice for early basis sets. Despite this accuracy, the great
shortcoming of STOs is that products of more than two STOs lead to
expressions that are <a href="https://www.theochem.ru.nl/~pwormer/Knowino/knowino.org/wiki/Slater_orbital.html">impossible to integrate</a> analytically. This is
in contrast to the most popular type of orbital used now, the
Gaussian type orbital (GTO), which when multiplied with another GTO
gives another translated GTO, which in turn can be readily
integrated analytically. This necessitated the use of approximation
techniques or semi-empirical parameters in STO calculations
involving more than two centers. The other big factor is a bit more
obvious but still important: old computers were slower and more
expensive to operate. This means that numerical integrals were often
too expensive or time-consuming to compute, which compounds the lack
of analytic forms for the multi-center STO integrals.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, one of the earliest studies on a triatomic
molecule necessitated the development of an early DF technique that
involved expanding two-center charge distributions by a
least-squares procedure as a sum of single-center charge
distributions centered on a line passing through the two
centers. This sounds complicated, but the main idea is summarized
readily by Fig. 2 from the paper <a href="https://ntrl.ntis.gov/NTRL/dashboard/searchResults/titleDetail/AD212985.xhtml">Boys and Shavitt (1959)</a> reproduced
below:
</p>


<div id="org81ecfdb" class="figure">
<p><img src="./figs/boys.png" alt="boys.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, the corresponding mathematical expression is given by the
equation
</p>

\begin{equation}
ab \cong \sum_{i}^m C_i p_i, 
\end{equation}

<p>
where the \(p_i\) are a uniform set of 20 symmetrically placed
exponential functions and the \(C_i\) are coefficients adjusted to
minimize the metric
</p>

\begin{equation}
\int(ab - \sum_p C_{i}p_i)d\tau,
\end{equation}

<p>
which is just the previous equation rearranged and integrated over
the set of two-center charge distributions \(ab\).
</p>

<p>
Basically, the authors approximate the difficult integrals by a
linear combination of primitive exponential functions. If you are
familiar with the STO-nG basis sets, and really any modern Gaussian
basis sets, this should sound quite familiar. The authors are
essentially describing a STO-20E basis set, where they approximate
an STO as a contraction of 20 exponential functions rather than n
Gaussian functions. This should serve as a clear indication of the
difficulty of the integrals themselves since the authors are willing
to increase the number of terms by a factor of 20 to obtain easier
computations.
</p>

<p>
Seven years later, in 1966, the same problems with STOs persisted,
and many more methods had been proposed to treat the necessary
integrals approximately by people you have probably heard
of. Mulliken, for example, proposed approximating a two-center
orbital product by the simple average of the single-center orbitals
involved. Löwdin made the rather straightforward suggestion to
extend this by taking the weighted average to preserve the correct
dipole moment. These and many more are described by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00528293">Harris and Rein</a>,
but the takeaway is that all of these methodologies can be seen as
taking the leading terms from infinite series expansions of the
two-center charge densities, much like Boys and Shavitt did. The
goal of the authors then was to use this perspective, combined with
a new procedure for optimizing the coefficients of the charge
densities, to yield the most accurate approximation scheme to date.
</p>

<p>
Their general scheme was to expand orbitals about one center in a
series about the other center using terms of each atomic symmetry,
where at least in this paper they have restricted themselves to
\(s\) and \(p\) symmetry as you can see in the figure below. They
use \(h\) to denote a 1\(s\) orbital, \(s\) for 2\(s\), \(\sigma\)
for the \(m=0\) 2\(p\) orbitals, and \(\pi\) for the \(m=\pm1\)
2\(p\) orbitals. The prime indicates the negative version.
</p>


<div id="orgfce4c70" class="figure">
<p><img src="./figs/defs.png" alt="defs.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Using these definitions, the products of the orbitals can be written
as
</p>


<div id="org0188433" class="figure">
<p><img src="./figs/prod1.png" alt="prod1.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
and
</p>


<div id="org04c3c0e" class="figure">
<p><img src="./figs/prod2.png" alt="prod2.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The rather primitive fitting is done by taking pairs of integrals
involving the same coefficients and solving the resulting linear
system, as shown in the example below, where \(c_3\) and \(c_4\) are
being determined.
</p>


<div id="orgd8da9d0" class="figure">
<p><img src="./figs/fit.png" alt="fit.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Once the coefficients are determined, the difficult, four-center
electron repulsion integrals can then be computed as linear
combinations of the much easier one-center integrals and two-center
Coulomb integrals. As the authors point out, this procedure requires
integrals on only \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) pairs of centers compared to
the \(n^4\) needed for the full computation, and they achieve
accuracies relative to the exact integral calculations of 1 kcal.
</p>

<p>
By 1971 the use of GTOs had become more widespread following the
introduction of the STO-nG basis sets by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1672392">John Pople in 1969</a>, but
there are some downsides of using GTOs as well. The chief among
these is the fact that GTOs have improper limiting behavior at both
the nucleus, where they are rounded instead of forming a cusp, and
at long range, where they decay too quickly. However, these issues
can be mitigated by taking linear combinations of multiple primitive
Gaussian functions to form something more closely resembling an
STO. As such, most modern software instead uses this type of GTOs
where multiple individual Gaussians are contracted into something
that can more closely emulate the limiting behavior of STOs. This
practice is most obvious in the naming of the aforementioned STO-nG
basis sets, which form approximate STOs from contractions of n
primitive (G)aussian functions. Another problem is that this
contraction scheme introduces a potentially large number of GTOs
relative to the number of STOs required, but now at least the
integrals can be evaluated analytically. Nevertheless, numbers were
larger in the 1970s relative to the available computer power, so
reducing the number of integrals by decomposing them into reusable
pieces was the problem <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1675655">Billingsley and Bloor</a> sought to address in
their work on the limited expansion of diatomic overlap (LEDO)
approximation. While this may sound somewhat different from the
earlier problem, this begins to illustrate the wide application of
the density fitting technique.
</p>

<p>
Another deficiency Billingsley and Bloor pointed out in the earlier
work, including that of Harris and Rein, was the lack of full
symmetry handling in the approximate two-center charge
distributions. For example, in the Harris and Rein formulation,
using only one 1\(s\) and 2\(p\) orbital for the approximations
leads to missing irreducible representations of the rotation groups
for the orbitals with \(p\) symmetry. This leads to incorrect or
missing nodal structures in the resulting approximate
distributions. To remedy this, Billingsley and Bloor suggested the
following definition for the two-center charge distribution
\(\pi_k^{AB}\):
</p>

\begin{equation}
\pi_k^{AB} \cong \sum_p^{\text{on }A}C_{kp}\Omega_p^A
+ \sum_q^{\text{on }B}C_{kq}\Omega_q^B
\end{equation}

<p>
where \(\Omega_p^A\) is a unique one-center distribution formed by
the product of two orbitals, \(\chi_m^A\chi_n^A\). This gives a set
of approximate two-center charge distributions as a linear
combination of the one-center distributions inherent in the basis
set of choice since we are summing over the unique sets of
one-center distributions on the two atomic centers in question. This
has the additional benefit of generalizing immediately to any set of
AO basis functions. With this formulation in hand, the authors now
needed to determine the \(C\) values. Because of the success of the
Harris-Rein approach there, they maintained the same approach of
fitting the coefficients to a relatively small set of exact
integrals but introduced a matrix notation more appropriate for the
larger systems of equations involved.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental equation here is
</p>

\begin{equation}
(\Omega_i^A | \frac{1}{r_{12}} | \pi_k^{AB}) \cong
\sum C_{kp}(\Omega_i^A| \frac{1}{r_{12}} | \Omega_p^B),
\end{equation}

<p>
where you can use the definitions
</p>

\begin{equation}
L_{ij} \equiv (\Omega_i^A | \frac{1}{r_{12}} | \pi_j^{AB})
\end{equation}

<p>
and
</p>

\begin{equation}
J_{ip} \equiv (\Omega_i^A| \frac{1}{r_{12}} | \Omega_p^B),
\end{equation}

<p>
to rewrite the problem as the matrix expression
</p>

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{L} = \boldsymbol{CJ},
\end{equation}

<p>
which can be solved for the coefficients by inverting
\(\boldsymbol{J}\). The authors point out that this inversion can be
quite touchy due to the often ill-conditioned \(\boldsymbol{J}\)
matrix, so care must be taken in performing it. However, the
resulting coefficients can be used in Eqn. 4 to yield the full set
of two-center charge distributions, which in turn are used to
generate three- and four-center integrals by taking linear
combinations of the one- and two-center Coulomb and hybrid
integrals. The agreement produced by the LEDO method is only 12.5
kcal/mol relative to full integral calculations, but as the authors
point out, this cannot be compared directly to the results of Harris
and Rein, who only looked at homonuclear diatomics, whereas
Billingsley and Bloor examined a test set including polyatomic
molecules like formaldehyde, methane, acetylene, and ethylene.

<h2 id="org77dc7d8"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Modern density fitting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2956507">Reine, et al.</a>, the modern version of density fitting
was introduced independently by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1679012">J. L. Whitten</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0301-0104(73)80059-X">Baerends, et al.</a>
in 1973, shortly after the developments of Billingsley and Bloor.
The basic idea in both of these formulations was to embed the
fitting procedure in the definition of the approximated
densities. In Whitten's words, the goal was "to relate the method of
determination of approximate densities directly to the error bound,"
in contrast to the previous work which proposed some form for the
approximate densities and then imposed an external metric for the
optimization. Whitten, in particular, sought a definition of the
approximate densities based on a definition of the error bound on
the approximation, leading to a clear path to optimization. For
Whitten the error bound of interest was
</p>

\begin{equation}
  |[\phi_a(1) | r_{12}^{-1} | \phi_b(2)]-[\phi_a'(1) | r_{12}^{-1} | \phi_b'(2)]| \leq \delta,
\end{equation}

<p>
where the primes indicate the approximate versions of the exact
one-particle charge densities \(\phi_a\) and \(\phi_b\). By a series
of proofs, Whitten demonstrates that minimization of the quantity
</p>

\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_a = [\phi_a(1) - \lambda_a\phi_a''(1) | r_{12}^{-1} | \phi_a(2) - \lambda_a\phi_a''(2) ]
\end{equation}

<p>
with respect to \(\lambda_a\) and the parameters of \(\phi_a''\),
which is \(\phi_a' / \lambda_a\) also minimizes the error in the
approximation, \(\delta\), as was desired. For the four-center
electron repulsion integrals this yields the approximation
</p>

\begin{equation}
  \int\phi_i^*(1)\phi_j(1)\frac{1}{r_{12}}\phi_k^*(2)\phi_l(2)
  \approx \lambda_{ij}\lambda_{kl}[\Phi_{ij}(1) | r_{12}^{-1} | \Phi_{kl}(2)],
\end{equation}

<p>
where \(\phi_i(1)\phi_j(1)\) is approximated by
\(\lambda_{ij}\Phi_{ij}(1)\) and the \(\Phi\)s are of some chosen
functional form. Whitten suggests that the interesting choices of
\(\Phi\) are either contractions of Gaussian functions, in which you
can choose a smaller number of Gaussians \(g_m'\) to represent the
full set \(g_m\) and approximate \(\Phi_{mn}\) as
\(\lambda_{mn}g_m'g_n'\), or using the expansion \(\Phi_{mn} =
  \sum_k^Mc_k\Omega_k\), which as Whitten points out is the same as
that suggested by Harris and Rein and Billingsley and
Bloor. Consequently, Whitten offers a more solid theoretical basis
for the work that came before him and formalizes the practice of
density fitting.
</p>

<p>
Now the major differences in implementations of DF arise in the
metric used to assess the fitting. Since Whitten's procedure relies
on \(\delta\) defined in terms of the Coulomb operator
\(r_{12}^{-1}\), his is referred to as the "Coulomb metric."
Baerends, et al., on the other hand, introduced what is known as the
"overlap metric," where the Coulomb operator is replaced by the
overlap operator defined as \(w = \delta(r_1 - r_2\).  by the
authors this is reminiscent of the LEDO procedure described by
Billingsley and Bloor, given that they approximate the density as
</p>

\begin{equation}
  \rho^{AB} = \sum_\mu^A \sum_\nu^B P_{\mu\nu}\chi_\mu^A\chi_\nu^B,
\end{equation}

<p>
but instead of fitting the full set of \(\chi_\mu^A\chi_\nu^B\),
they restrict themselves to a smaller set of \(s\) type STOs, which
is somewhat more similar to the original Boys and Shavitt
approach. Obviously this selection satisfies the mathematical
constraints described by Whitten with the \(s\) type STOs taking the
place of the \(\Phi\) functions. Something to point out explicitly
here is that these \(\Phi\)s serve as an auxiliary basis in which to
carry out the calculation. Rather than working in the original basis
with functions on each nucleus, you can reduce the problem
conceptually to operating in the auxiliary basis with functions in
the space between nuclei.
</p>

<p>
According again to Reine, not to be confused with Rein of the Harris
and Rein work, who reviewed these developments in 2008, later work
by Dunlap revealed that the Coulomb metric of Whitten was superior
to the overlap metric suggested by Baerends. This is somewhat
unsurprising to me given the mathematical rigor of Whitten's
approach compared to that of Baerends, et al. However, the Baerends
work was trying to solve the more specific problem of computing
properties of large molecules for which it was necessary to abandon
some rigor. Their approach offered a substantial improvement over
the contemporary standard of using semi-empirical methods and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffin-tin_approximation">muffin-tin approximation</a>, so it certainly served its
purpose. Nevertheless, later work has sought to build on the Coulomb
metric as a result of its greater accuracy.
</p>

<p>
This is where the work of Reine, et al. fits. As they point out in
2008, the development of HF and density functional theory (DFT)
procedures that scale linearly made even density fitted integral
calculations, which scale cubically in the full Coulomb metric, the
slow step in HF and DFT computations. As such, they sought a
linear-scaling DF approach to keep up with these faster methods. To
achieve this, they built on the local atomic density fitting (LADF)
and atomic resolution of the identity (ARI) approaches of Sodt et
al., which rely on pruning the auxiliary basis down to those
functions that are suitably close to the atoms in question. However,
these earlier approaches had relied on the choice of an artifactual
"bump" function to implement the pruning. Reine et al. then devised
a method of pruning the auxiliary basis that was more robust while
maintaining the variational property of the LADF approach. The
mathematics are rather involved, so I will defer to the original
work for those interested in the details of this "local" fitting
metric.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the metric, Equation 13 gives the concise definition
of density fitting. The choice of \(\Phi\) is the choice of the
auxiliary basis to perform the density fitting on, and the metric
chosen will affect the fitting procedure or equivalently the
determination of the \(\lambda\) values.

<a href="https://doi-org.umiss.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/0009-2614(93)87156-W">Feyereisen et al</a>. \(m\) denotes an auxiliary basis in the space of
\(ij\), which it can either expand completely or approximate via an
incomplete expansion. This is useful not only for HF, in which the
resulting integrals are used directly, but also in post-HF methods
like MP2, which require the transformation of the AO basis into the
molecular orbital (MO) basis. If you have done the <a href="https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects">Crawford
programming projects</a>, you will know that even in the best case the
MO transformation scales as \(\mathcal{O}(N^5)\) when using the
four-center integrals. Using the RI/DF approximation reduces the
integrals to three-center integrals and correspondingly reduces the
MO transformation to \(\mathcal{O}(N^4)\). Similar improvements can
be attained in coupled-cluster computations, as suggested by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.468148">Rendell

Density fitting is a powerful technique for speeding up quantum
chemical calculations. Initially it was used to approximate
intractable integrals inherent in STO calculations, but it has now
been utilized to reduce the number of integrals that must be
calculated in computations using large GTO basis sets. Additionally,
the RI formalism helps to extend the performance gains of using
density-fit integrals to correlated methods like MP2 and
coupled-cluster theory, making density fitting an invaluable
