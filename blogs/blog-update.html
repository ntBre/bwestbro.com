<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>If you’ve been following the blog for a while, you’ll know that I
don’t post very frequently. At the time of writing this (9 July 2024),
my last post was on 12 December 2021. One of the biggest reasons for
this is that I haven’t come up with a good pipeline for writing and
publishing posts. Each of my blog posts is simply an HTML file in the
<code>blogs</code> subdirectory of my website <a
href="https://github.com/ntBre/bwestbro.com">repo</a>. Originally I
would just write them in HTML directly, but because I spend so much time
in Emacs, I started experimenting with writing my posts in Org Mode.
This is quite nice for the actual writing part of the process because
I’m very familiar with Org, and I can use all of my normal editing
snippets for inserting code blocks and equations and stuff like that.
However, I don’t really like the process of exporting from Org to HTML
for publication on my site. At first glance,
<code>org-export-dispatch</code> looks really nice, and it has a handy
default binding of <code>C-c C-e</code>. On the other hand, this
interactive approach makes it more difficult to perform this export as
part of a script or Makefile<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. One other quibble I
have with Org export is that it includes a lot of junk in the generated
HTML. Here’s a snippet from the top of one of my Org-exported posts:</p>

<p>Again, I’m sure there is a way to configure this, and I vaguely
remember trying that in the past, but it’s just annoying to me.</p>
<p>The approach most people seem to take is to use a tool like <a
href="https://pandoc.org">pandoc</a> to convert from Markdown to HTML,
so that is what I’m trying with this post. Despite resisting Markdown
for a while in favor of Org Mode (including <code>README.org</code>
files on GitHub), I already use <code>markdown-mode</code> in Emacs for
editing most of my READMEs, so I’m fairly familiar with the key bindings
and useful functions. I have also used <code>pandoc</code> a bit in the
past and expect it to be more amenable to scripting as part of my
website repo.</p>
<p>One other minor issue I’ve run into in the past before we get to some
<code>pandoc</code> code is that I don’t really know where to keep draft
blog posts. I have my website repo set to public in case it’s useful for
others to see how to write a small web server in Go, but I don’t
necessarily want to keep draft blog posts in public. In the past, I’ve
kept these drafts in another private repo to keep them backed up and
then export them into the main site repo when they are ready to publish.
However, that introduces a couple of layers of friction from my
perspective. Namely, when I go three years without publishing a blog
post, it’s easy to forget where I kept old drafts if they aren’t
alongside the published versions. Secondarily, it slightly complicates
the export process that I want to streamline. Thus, I’ve decided to keep
a git-ignored <code>drafts</code> directory in my website repo, at least
for now.</p>
<p>A final minor “issue” is that I also have my YouTube channel to
consider. Many of the topics I want to blog about also make for good
video topics, which has led me to procrastinate both writing and video
production. On that front, I’ve decided that if I feel like writing, I
should just write<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, not delay the writing for a
hypothetical video. If anyone reads my blog at all, the audience is
likely much smaller than my YouTube audience and also likely disjoint,
so I don’t think I’m really going to bore anyone with duplicate content.
Further, putting my thoughts down in writing first should lead to better
videos if I get around to them eventually.</p>
<h1 id="exporting-with-pandoc">Exporting with pandoc</h1>
<p>Now that I’ve motivated the code in this post, let me lay out the
(relevant) structure of my repo:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>├── Makefile
├── blogs
├── css
├── drafts
│   └── blog-update.md
├── go.mod
├── img
├── json
│   ├── blogs.json
├── misc
├── server.go
├── server_test.go
├── templates
└── worksheets</code></pre>
<p>I’ve omitted most of the subdirectories and files within these
directories for clarity. You can see this very blog post in Markdown
form in my <code>drafts</code> directory under the name
<code>blog-update.md</code>. My server populates the list of blog posts
based on the contents of the <code>json/blogs.json</code> file. Because
it reads the filename from the JSON entries, I don’t necessarily
<em>have</em> to put the output HTML into the <code>blogs</code>
directory, but that’s where I want them to go. In Go, the
<code>Blog</code> struct is this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode go"><code class="sourceCode go"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">type</span> Blog <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    Title    <span class="dt">string</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    Filename <span class="dt">string</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    Date     <span class="dt">string</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    Content  <span class="dt">string</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>but I only include <code>Title</code>, <code>Filename</code>, and
<code>Date</code> in the JSON data, loading <code>Content</code> at
runtime only when the page is requested. Anyway, the two main things I
need to do to preview a new blog post are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add an entry to <code>blogs.json</code></li>
<li>Export the Markdown file to HTML in the <code>blogs</code>
directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>As much as <a href="https://youtu.be/tTnImV8fmwc">I hate Python</a>,
it has a fairly convenient <code>json</code> module in the standard
library, and it seems like overkill to bust out Rust and
<code>serde</code> for a simple task like this<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
One of the things I hate about Python is using dictionaries where I
would typically use a <code>struct</code> in Rust or Go.</p>
<p>This is a bit of an aside, but if you can’t guess it already, we’re
building up to another issue with my current blogging setup. I’m about
to start working on a Python file that will be included in the repo and
also including snippets of that file in this blog post. In previous
posts I have simply copy-pasted code, which leads to it getting out of
sync between the actual code file and the blog post. Somewhat
surprisingly, it seems that <code>pandoc</code> cannot handle inclusion
of code files by default<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, so this seems like an opportunity
to try out the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">m4</a> macro
processor. Unfortunately, m4 also cannot handle ranges of lines by
default, but it at least has a <code>syscmd</code> macro that will let
me shell out to sed to grab the lines I need. Including ranges like this
should make it easier to structure my code however I want. For example,
this snippet should expand into itself(!):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode m4"><code class="sourceCode m4"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">syscmd</span><span class="ch">(</span>{{sed <span class="ch">-</span>n <span class="dv">144</span>p drafts<span class="ch">/</span>blog<span class="ch">-</span>update.md}}<span class="ch">)</span><span class="kw">dnl</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As long as I remember to keep the line number updated if I edit
anything above it. If I have to adjust the line too many times, I’ll
switch to a regular expression in the sed command to remove that
issue.</p>
<p>Because m4 also defaults to using `’ as its quoting characters, I
also have to include this at the top of the file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode m4"><code class="sourceCode m4"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">changequote</span><span class="ch">(</span>`{{&#39;<span class="ch">,</span> `}}&#39;<span class="ch">)</span><span class="kw">dnl</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>to change the quoting scheme to something more like Go or jinja
templates and something that will not conflict with the backticks all
over Markdown. The trailing <code>dnl</code> keeps m4 from including any
extra whitespace. Now all I have to do to include code snippets is to
preprocess my Markdown files with m4. Let’s start a publish script to
keep track of the steps. In this case, I won’t mess with m4, as I expect
that the actual steps I use will change as the project goes along. For
now, all I know to do is</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>m4 blog-update.md</code></pre>
<p>which produces the macro-expanded version of the file on stdout. I’ll
either pipe that to a temporary file later or send it directly into
pandoc on stdin.</p>
<p>For now, let’s get back to the original issue at hand: modifying
<code>blogs.json</code> programmatically. Again, the first thing I want
to do is define a simple <code>Blog</code> class that mirrors the Go
version above:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">@dataclass</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">class</span> Blog:</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    Title: <span class="bu">str</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    Filename: <span class="bu">str</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    Date: <span class="bu">str</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here I’m using a <code>dataclass</code> to take advantage of the
automatic constructor generation and, more importantly, the
<code>asdict</code> function provided for these classes in my JSON
serialization code. It’s not very Pythonic, but I’m keeping the Go
casing for the variable names to make deserializing a little easier.
Speaking of that, we can load a sequence of <code>Blog</code>s from a
file with this function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> load_blogs(filename):</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">with</span> <span class="bu">open</span>(filename) <span class="im">as</span> f:</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="cf">return</span> [Blog(<span class="op">**</span>d) <span class="cf">for</span> d <span class="kw">in</span> json.load(f)]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For a simple interface, I’ll just pass the existing blogs file as the
first command line argument, and the name of the new blog file as the
second argument. Then, I just check if a blog with that filename already
exists, and if not, I add it to the front of the list and overwrite the
file with the new contents. For now, I’ll just expect to edit the
<code>Title</code> manually, so I’ll use the filename for that as
well:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="va">__name__</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;__main__&quot;</span>:</span>

<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> <span class="kw">not</span> <span class="bu">any</span>((b.Filename <span class="op">==</span> name <span class="cf">for</span> b <span class="kw">in</span> blogs)):</span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        date <span class="op">=</span> datetime.today().strftime(<span class="st">&quot;%Y-%m-</span><span class="sc">%d</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        blogs.insert(<span class="dv">0</span>, Blog(name, name, date))</span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">with</span> <span class="bu">open</span>(sys.argv[<span class="dv">1</span>], <span class="st">&quot;w&quot;</span>) <span class="im">as</span> out:</span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        json.dump(blogs, out, default<span class="op">=</span><span class="kw">lambda</span> o: asdict(o), indent<span class="op">=</span><span class="dv">4</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, I have code snippets handled with m4 and updating
<code>blogs.json</code> with this <code>publish.py</code> script. The
only step missing is converting to HTML with pandoc. One other minor
issue is where to plan to run this code. When writing, my working
directory will be <code>drafts</code>, and there are two easy ways of
compiling code in Emacs. The first is simply to use
<code>M-x compile</code>, which uses the current directory as its
working directory. The second, and the one I use more often, is
<code>projectile-compile-project</code>, which compiles at the root of
the project. I think it probably makes more sense then to run my script
for publishing a blog post in this way. That really only requires me to
make every file path (such as in the m4 macros) relative to the project
root instead of the drafts directory.</p>
<p>First, let’s modify the m4 command above to pipe through pandoc.
According to the manual, if no input file is specified and no input file
type is provided, pandoc defaults to reading Markdown from stdin, which
is exactly what we want. All we need to do is provide the output format,
HTML in this case:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>m4 drafts/blog-update.md | pandoc -o blogs/blog-update.html</code></pre>
<p>There are a couple of convenience issues to fix with this when we
promote it to an actual script, but it works well enough for now.
Unfortunately, my site’s current styling looks absolutely horrible with
the HTML generated by pandoc, but that is also a fairly separate issue
from this post. I think I’ll try writing a new style sheet for these new
posts to avoid too many conflicts with my existing pages.</p>
<p>Anyway, styling aside, we now have all of the necessary components
for a publish script:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>#!/bin/bash

m4 drafts/blog-update.md | pandoc -o blogs/blog-update.html
scripts/publish.py json/blogs.json drafts/blog-update.md</code></pre>
<p>The only finishing touches are to pass in (and process) some command
line arguments and then I should be back into blogging! Here’s the final
shell script after applying two of my favorite bash tricks for removing
prefixes and suffixes:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>#!/bin/bash

md_file=$1
base=${md_file%.md} # trim .md extension
blog_file=${base##*/}

m4 $md_file | pandoc -o blogs/${blog_file}.html
scripts/publish.py json/blogs.json $md_file
</code></pre>
<p>For completeness, here are the full contents of
<code>scripts/publish.py</code> too:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I’m glad I decided to do this today. It took a couple of hours, but I
now feel like I am well-equipped to write a post about anything that
strikes my fancy. My workflow throughout this process has been to run
<code>./scripts/publish drafts/blog-update.md</code> with
<code>projectile-compile-project</code> and use my
<code>recompile</code> key binding on F5 to recompile the HTML after
changing the Markdown file. With the Go server running locally in a
background terminal window, this means I can preview the changes
basically in real time. If I ever write about something
chemistry-related, I’ll have to extend these scripts to handle LaTeX
blocks in addition to code blocks, but hopefully that won’t be too bad.
The combination of m4 and pandoc already seems much nicer than my
previous setup with Org Mode, and I look forward to writing my next
post!</p>

code either in a script or from the command line, but I think it’s still
not ideal.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

When I was doing my PhD, writing papers was a major part of my regular
work and one that I enjoyed. My current position involves basically no
writing, so I should try to keep in practice somehow.<a href="#fnref2"

<li id="fn3"><p>Go and its JSON package would be more natural than Rust,
but I don’t really have much interest in writing Go these days. I’d be
more likely to rewrite the whole server in Rust than to write any
additional features in Go.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn4"><p>There is a promising-looking filter called <a

with all of the features I’m looking for, but it appears to be
unmaintained with potentially annoying issues remaining open.<a
