Go's interfaces are useful tools for abstraction, but they can be a
bit confusing when you are first starting out. I know that was the
case for me since I have never programmed in an object-oriented
paradigm that would give me familiarity with class hierarchies and the
notion of implementing interfaces. Even if I had, my understanding is
that in other languages you usually tell the compiler that a new class
implements some interface. Go's approach is somewhat different, in
that any type can implement a given interface if it has the right
methods. I'm not knowledgeable enough about the OOP approach to really
contrast them, but the Go approach is certainly convenient for using
your own types in preexisting libraries.
</p>

<p>
You are confronted with interfaces in Go early on, especially if you
want to read and write files. File reading and writing functions
generally take io.Readers and io.Writers, or more specific but related
types like io.ReadWriters or even io.ReadWriteClosers. My first Go
projects had to read and parse many files, so I was forced to come up
to speed with the basics of interfaces pretty quickly, which basically
means I had to understand that an io.Reader has a Read() method and an
io.Closer() has a Close() method, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Another place you can encounter an interface is in the gonum.org/mat
package, which offers a Matrix interface and the associated linear
algebra operations. It was teaching parts of this package to one of my
labmates that led to this post, which is basically just an example of
an interface.
</p>

<p>
While technically distinct, Go's interfaces are similar to the idea of
"duck typing." Duck typing uses the expression "if it looks like a
duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a
duck" to determine the type of a given object. The easiest way to see
this is by way of an example. Let's define a Duck interface
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-go">type Duck interface {
	Look()
	Swim()
	Quack()
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
that includes these actions, 1) "look" like a duck, 2) "swim" like a
duck, and 3) "quack" like a duck. And we can then define a function
that requires a Duck argument
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-go">func Pet(d Duck) { return }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Duck itself is an abstract type, so to do much with it you need to
construct a concrete type that implements the Duck interface. To
implement an interface, a type needs to have the methods defined in
the interface itself, which is where the connection to the duck
expression comes in. A Mallard implements the Duck interface:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-go">type Mallard struct{}

func (m Mallard) Look()  {}
func (m Mallard) Swim()  {}
func (m Mallard) Quack() {}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
but a Heron does not
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-go">type Heron struct{}

func (h Heron) Look() {}
func (h Heron) Swim() {}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
because it is missing the Quack method. You can see this if you
actually write up this code and try to pass a Heron to our Pet
function. The compiler should give a pretty helpful message pointing
out the problem:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">./main.go:42:5: cannot use h (type Heron) as type Duck in argument to Pet:
	Heron does not implement Duck (missing Quack method)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
One tricky part is that the method signatures have to be identical to
the ones defined in the interface. This means that the following
Pintail type, with its Quack method returning a string, does not
implement the Duck interface.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-go">type Pintail struct{}

func (p Pintail) Look()         {}
func (p Pintail) Swim()         {}
func (p Pintail) Quack() string { return "quack" }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Again the compiler tells you pretty much exactly that:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">./main.go:43:5: cannot use p (type Pintail) as type Duck in argument to Pet:
	Pintail does not implement Duck (wrong type for Quack method)
		have Quack() string
		want Quack()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Another common mistake, especially when working with the
aforementioned mat package, is to think something implements an
interface, when really a pointer to the something implements it. For
example, the following Teal type would not implement the Mallard
interface, but a pointer to a Teal would. In other words, you can
write Pet(&amp;Teal{}), but not Pet(Teal{}).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-go">type Teal struct{}

func (t *Teal) Look()  {}
func (t *Teal) Swim()  {}
func (t *Teal) Quack() {}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Yet again, the compiler is usually quite helpful in these situations,
indicating that the method actually has a pointer receiver, which
should be all the hint you need to add an "&amp;" in front of your object,
but it can still seem mysterious when you first start out.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">./main.go:44:5: cannot use t (type Teal) as type Duck in argument to Pet:
	Teal does not implement Duck (Look method has pointer receiver)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A final thing to note is that the concrete types can have other
methods than those defined by the interface. This allows a single type
to implement many different interfaces. For example, the Wigeon type
below implements our Duck interface, while also implementing the
io.Writer interface, albeit in a useless way. It also includes two
other methods unrelated to either of those interfaces just for fun.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-go">type Wigeon struct{}

func (w Wigeon) Look()                             {}
func (w Wigeon) Swim()                             {}
func (w Wigeon) Quack()                            {}
func (w Wigeon) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) { return 0, nil }
func (w Wigeon) Eat()                              {}
func (w Wigeon) Drink()                            {}
</pre>
</div>
