<p>This is the first in a new series of posts I plan to do reviewing
books I’ve read recently. As I mentioned in my previous post, this is
another victim of YouTube procrastination because I’ve considered making
this a video series instead of a blog series. Nonetheless, I’m finally
sitting down to work on it, and I think this is a great place to
start.</p>
<p>Today’s review is for the excellent book <em>Crafting
Interpreters</em>, which walks you through two different implementations
of the same dynamic, interpreted, scripting language, Lox. Every line of
code is included in the book, and the author Robert Nystrom complements
the code with commentary on a broad range of topics from language design
to computer history to computer science fundamentals. The first Lox
implementation is a straightforward tree-walking interpreter written in
Java (giving it the abbreviated name jlox), while the second
implementation is a more complicated but more performant bytecode
virtual machine in C (clox). If this is your first interpreter or
programming language book, I think this is a very good progression.</p>
<p>As you’ll see if you follow this <a
href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">link</a>, one of the amazing
things about <em>Crafting Interpreters</em> is that it is available in
full online. I personally prefer reading on paper, so I ordered the
physical copy from Amazon, which, as the website indicates, consists of
“640 pages of beautiful typography and high resolution hand-drawn
illustrations.” It’s a little pricey at $60, but for such a good (and
expansive) book, I think it’s well worth it. I don’t want to start the
review off on a negative note, but I will point out that it’s quite a
large book at nearly three pounds and eight by ten inches. This makes it
a little bit uncomfortable to read in bed, but if you’re really worried
about that, you can get the ebook, PDF, or web versions.</p>
<p>Before I dive fully into the review, I should note that I didn’t read
this book all at once. I originally purchased the book in early 2023 and
just finished it in mid-2024. As a result, my memory, especially of the
early jlox chapters, will be a bit fuzzy. I should also note that I did
not read this book in what I would consider the most productive way. To
get the most out of this book, you should follow along with each line of
code, typing it into your editor yourself, running the tests you can
retrieve from the accompanying GitHub repository, and even trying out
some of the exercises given at the end of each chapter. I took this
approach in my initial reading of the jlox section, but after a long
break from reading the book, I decided that I just wanted to read
through the remaining several hundred pages rather than implement each
part of the interpreter. Still, I think I learned a lot from reading
alone, especially after solidifying some of the fundamentals in the jlox
implementation. I also plan to keep my copy of the book handy as I work
on a toy language of my own. I think it will serve as a very useful
reference in addition to being a pleasurable read. To round out the
preliminary caveats, for the parts of both jlox and clox that I
implemented, I also did not follow along in Java and C, respectively.
Instead, I attempted to port both implementations to Rust. As I will
expand on later, I think this choice has both pros and cons.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to start with the book’s strengths. As mentioned
above, it’s well-written, well-organized, and very detailed. In fact, I
think this book could possibly be used by beginners to
<em>programming</em> not just beginners to writing programming
languages. Nystrom provides such detailed explanations of algorithms and
data structures that I think the book is very approachable. The clearest
example for me, having not read the jlox section for almost a year, is
the hash table implementation in chapter 20. This is one of the greatest
strengths (and weaknesses) of C, in my opinion: that you have to do a
lot of things yourself. Because Nystrom decided to write the byte-code
version of Lox in C, there’s no hash table in the standard library to
import. As such, he builds a hash table from the ground up, just as he
builds Lox from the ground up in the rest of the book. Similarly, he
presents another great introduction to dynamic arrays in chapter 14. At
first this might seem like a bit of a diversion from the task at hand,
and you could skip it if you really want to, but I always like to see
how another programmer, especially a veteran programmer like Nystrom,
writes and structures their code. Hash tables in particular also have
various tradeoffs in their implementations, and the author does a good
job of justifying his choices for a language like Lox. I personally
already had a pretty good understanding of these data structures and how
they were built, but I still found these chapters worthwhile for myself,
as well as seeing them as a massive value for newer programmers.</p>
<p>Along these lines, one of my biggest issues when learning to program
was finding a project to work on. I read multiple programming books but
never really wrote much code because I didn’t have a pressing need to
build anything<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. As such, I think this book could be
a perfect fit for learning to program. It gives you a clear project, all
of the code you need, and also a good foundation in computer science
basics. The challenges at the ends of the chapters also give you
directions for where to extend the code, but I have to imagine that
anyone reading this book will have the itch to apply its lessons to
completely separate languages of their own design.</p>
<p>However, this raises some of the issues I have with the book. I can’t
really speak for the wider audience of the book, but Java especially is
not a language I like. I might be scarred from my horrible experience
with Java in AP Computer Science in high school or from my very boring
intro to CS class in college, but I just don’t like Java at all. I was
able to get through the jlox chapters because the quality of the book is
really good, and I was porting the code to Rust anyway.</p>
<p>This is probably as good a place as any to expand on the pros and
cons of this approach mentioned above. The main benefit for me is that
porting code from one language to another requires you to internalize
the meaning of the code as you read and then write it rather than simply
typing in what was given to you. I think there is something magical
about typing something out yourself as many introductory programming
texts point out, but I think having to translate the code into the
syntax and idioms of a different language has an even greater effect on
your understanding. The negative side, of course, is that you’re now on
your own for any bugs you encounter. My jlox implementation in Rust
still cannot properly handle variable resolution because of an issue
with my <code>Environment</code> implementation<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Part of this difficulty comes from the fact that Java is a
garbage-collected language and Rust is not, so I can’t follow the code
in this section (which uses mutable pointers between
<code>Environment</code> instances) very directly. I’ve tried multiple
versions with <code>Arc&lt;Cell&lt;Environment&gt;&gt;</code> stuff,
propagating lifetimes throughout the code, and so on. I think I’ve
learned enough Rust in the past year that I could probably resolve this
issue now, but it was pretty frustrating at the time. If you chose
another garbage-collected language like Go or Python or even OCaml, the
port would likely be much smoother.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I do have some more concrete criticisms
about Java and the jlox section of the book beyond not liking Java. In
particular, I think the OOP focus of Java<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
takes away from the primary focus in places. The most vivid example of
this starts in chapter 5, where the foundation is laid for using the
Visitor pattern to evaluate expressions. This culminates in chapter 8,
where the author writes a code generation script to generate all of the
classes to implement the Visitor pattern for all of the types of
expressions and statements. Again my memory is a bit fuzzy, so apologies
if the chapter numbers aren’t quite right, but the point stands. I also
looked back at my jlox implementation, and I don’t see any code
generation, at least at a cursory glance. I appear to have implemented
my expression evaluation with a big <code>match</code> on the various
types that I put in an <code>enum</code>. I should probably defer to
Nystrom’s experience and expertise here, but generating a big pile of
OOP classes with a separate Java script just doesn’t smell right to me.
But one OOPsie daisy doesn’t ruin the whole jlox implementation, and,
again, it’s interesting to see how different people write the same code
anyway.</p>
<p>I can’t lodge any of the same complaints about C because, as
mentioned above, C has some aspects going it for it as well. The
simplicity of the C language makes for some of the great, basic
explanations I lauded above. C is even easier to port to Rust, at least
in the parts I’ve tried so far. In the worst cases, you should be able
to match C pretty much exactly using <code>unsafe</code>, as I’ve done
in my <a href="https://github.com/ntBre/rwm">rwm</a> project. The only
downside I can really think of for C is that most people, especially
beginners, probably would not pick it as their first choice, which is
really a criticism I would share for both Java and C. I’m obviously
heavily biased toward Rust, which has its own challenges for beginners,
especially in the jlox/tree-walking version of the code. As such, I
think Go is probably a very appealing choice and one that is used in
another interpreter book that I have not read but have heard about
online<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. The language selection is basically
my only hesitation in recommending the book to self-taught programmers,
but if colleges are still teaching Java, it could be perfect for college
freshmen wanting to go beyond their classes.</p>
<p>My final minor complaints are about the testing framework and the Lox
language itself. The first of these hardly even seems fair because it’s
obviously positive that the author provides a testing framework in the
first place, available in the GitHub repository corresponding to the
book<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. The complaint is just that it’s
written in a third, separate language, Dart. This is unfair in its own
way because Nystrom works at Google on the Dart team, so I can hardly
blame him for wanting to use (presumably) his preferred tool, but it
does add another dependency into the mix, if you want to test your Lox
implementation. On the one hand it makes sense why the tests aren’t
written in Java or C<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>; you want them to be runnable
against both jlox and clox implementations and even against
implementations in other languages never considered by the author (like
my Rust implementation). On the other hand, I probably would have gone
for a more ubiquitous language like Python if I were going for
portability and generality. The <code>test.dart</code> file in the repo
is 694 lines of code, but conceptually I think it just runs the provided
lox binary on some example scripts and compares the output to the
desired output, so it shouldn’t be too complicated. Anyway, again, it’s
hard to complain about getting nice tests for free, even if they take a
little effort to set up if you’re not a regular Dart user.</p>
<p>For Lox itself, it’s just not really the kind of language I would
really want to have. It’s semantically similar to Python I guess, with
an appearance more like C++ or Java:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>class Base {
  toString() { return &quot;Base&quot;; }
}

class Derived &lt; Base {
  getClosure() {
    fun closure() {
      return super.toString();
    }
    return closure;
  }

  toString() { return &quot;Derived&quot;; }
}

var closure = Derived().getClosure();
print closure(); // expect: Base</code></pre>
<p>But now I’m really in the weeds. As described throughout the book,
the features of the language lead to interesting implementation details,
and the point is not to end up with everyone’s new favorite scripting
language.</p>
<p>At times I also wondered about the structure of the book. Chunks of
code are presented in one chapter and then later revised as the language
gets more features. This can give the code in the book a bit of a
fragmented feeling, and I lost some of my understanding of the overall
organization. However, it just occurred to me that if I had actually
been following along with my own code, the monitor in front of me would
have had the whole structure on it or at least accessible. Thus, I can’t
even really call this a valid complaint. There might be some case for
presenting all of the code at once and walking through it linearly, but
I think the iterative approach in the book more closely models the real
development process and is simply much easier to follow.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I feel like I spent way too long on the “issues” in the book for the
strong positive perception I have of it. I guess it’s just more fun to
critique than to try to praise things. You can consider anything not
mentioned in this handful of complaints to be very good, which possibly
made these points stick out to me more clearly. I’m not sure I want to
give the books I review ratings, but I guess I will start off with one
just in case I want to continue that in the future. My first thought is
a 9/10, but equating that to a 90% or A- grade seems too low. On the
other hand, I want to maintain a little room at the top for something
like my favorite book ever, so I won’t just give it a 10/10. I really do
find it easier to reason about things in terms of grades, so I’ll
probably settle for a solid A, around 95/100 or 9.5/10. Regardless, I
highly recommend this book if you’re interested in how programming
languages work and even the field of computer science more broadly. You
can use it like a workbook, following along with each line of code as
it’s presented, but it’s also full of insight and just a pleasurable
read if you like technical books.</p>
