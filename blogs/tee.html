  If you're familiar with the shell, you've probably come across the
  concept of "piping" commands into each other.  A frequently-used
  example of this is looking for a process in <code>ps</code> by
  running <code>grep</code> on the resulting output:
</p>

<div class=code>
  $ ps aux | grep process-name
</div>

<p>
  This pattern is exceptionally useful and comes up in numerous
  situations when working in the shell. However, sometimes you run into
  scenarios where you really need multiple pipelines at once or need to
  combine the output from several different commands. One option is
  always to redirect the output from one of the pipelines into a
  temporary file, but it can be nice to avoid this when possible. This
  is where process substitution and the <code>tee</code> command can
  come into play.

<h3 class=sub>Process substitution</h3>

<p>
  Much as the name indicates, process substitution allows you to
  substitute the results from one process as a file for a command.
  The syntax for this is very similar to normal redirection of stdin
  and stdout, but with the addition of parentheses. One of my frequent
  uses for process substitution is combining columns of output from
  different commands with the <code>paste</code> command. If you don't know,
  the paste command "merges lines of files" according to its man page.
  For example, if I have file a:
</p>

<div class=code>
  1 <br> 2 <br> 3 <br> 4 <br> 5
</div>

<p>and a similar file b:</p>

<div class=code>
  6 <br> 7<br>  8<br>  9<br>  10
</div>

<p>
  I can combine them together with <code>paste a b</code> to get
</p>
<div class=code>
  1 6 <br> 2 7 <br> 3 8 <br> 4 9 <br> 5 10 <br>
</div>

<p>
  This is obviously a useful command on its own, but what if I only want to paste
  together a certain column from a multi-column file? Or what if I want to use
  AWK to modify the columns in some way before pasting them together?
  This is where process substitution comes in.
</p>

<p>
  Let's stick with the second of these situations for now, and assume we want to
  multiply the values in file a by 5 and those in file b by 2. One way of doing this
  is
</p>

<div class=code>
  paste &lt;( awk '{print $1*5}' a ) &lt;( awk '{print $1*2}' b )
</div>

<p> which results in the output below. </p>
<div class=code>
  &nbsp;5       12 <br>
  10      14 <br>
  15      16 <br>
  20      18 <br>
  25      20 <br>
</div>

<p>
  One thing to make explicit is that process substitution is a feature
  of bash, not shells in general, at least with the syntax I have
  described here. I can only speak for the three I tried, bash, fish,
  and sh, but of those at least only bash utilized the syntax
  described above. The main time I have run into trouble with this is
  when writing a shell script and trying to use <code>#!/bin/sh</code>
  as my shebang line, but if you use a shell other than bash as your
  default shell you will likely have trouble as well.
</p>

<h3 class=sub>tee</h3>

<p>
  So that's process substitution, but what's this <code>tee</code>
  thing?  According to its man page, <code>tee</code> allows you to
  "read from standard input and write to standard output <em>and</em> files."
  I've added emphasis here to focus on the really useful part of the command.
  Whereas normal pipelines have one way in and one way out, the aptly named
  <code>tee</code> acts just like a tee joint in a physical pipeline,
  allowing you to redirect information flow in multiple directions. A
  basic use in a variant of our first example command would log all
  running processes, while also continuing on to look for a certain one.
</p>

<div class=code>
  $ ps aux | tee ps.log | grep process-name
</div>

<p>
  This writes the file ps.log with the full output from <code>ps</code>
  while also piping that full output on to <code>grep</code>, which will
  direct its output to stdout as usual.
</p>

<h3 class=sub>Combining the two</h3>

<p>
  What prompted this post was working on a script to summarize the output
  from the <code>qstat</code> command on one of our clusters, which basically just
  reports information about the running jobs. By default it returns information
  about all users, which you can filter down to only your username with the
  <code>-u</code> flag, but since I'm searching for stuff anyway, and
  I'm in the middle of reading <em>The AWK Programming Language</em>,
  I went ahead and searched for my username anyway with the help of
  AWK.
</p>
<div class=code>
  <pre>qstat | awk 'BEGIN {q = r = e =0} FNR == 1 {print} \
    (/USER/ && / [QRE] /) {if (/Q/) q++; if (/R/) r++; \
    if (/E/) e++; print} END \
    {printf "%d in queue\n%d running\n%d exiting\n", q, r, e}' \
    | tee >( head -n -3 ) >( tail -n 3 ) > /dev/null</pre>
</div>

<p>
  The AWK part of this is not that interesting or at least the topic of a separate
  post, so let us focus on the <code>tee</code> part.
</p>
<div class=code>
  tee >( head -n -3 ) >( tail -n 3 ) > /dev/null
</div>

<p>
  As we saw above, process substitution can be used to substitute the
  output from a command for a file used as the standard input for
  another command. However, you can also substitute a process for a
  file being used to catch the standard output from a command. That is
  what is happening here. <code>tee</code> writes what was piped into
  it to the files <code>head -n -3</code> and <code>tail -n 3</code>,
  which print all but the last three lines and the last three lines of
  the pipeline respectively.
</p>

<p>
  To make this a little more clear, the output of the AWK command on its own
  looks something like
</p>

<div class=code>
  Job id            Name             User              Time Use S Queue <br>
  12345            jobName           brent             00:00    R Q1 <br>
  0 in queue <br>
  0 running <br>
  0 exiting
</div>

<p>
  because counting up how many jobs are in queue, running, and exiting
  cannot finish until all of the input lines have been read, and by
  then there is no way to write it to the top of the output with AWK*.
  My earlier version of this script embarassingly ran
  multiple <code>qstat</code> commands and gathered the output into
  variables that were then printed at the end. While this version is
  not formatted very well and looks kind of rough, it runs three times
  faster than that one, while also providing more information.
</p>

<p>
  The output after the <code>tee</code> line is 
</p>

<div class=code>
  0 in queue <br>
  0 running <br>
  0 exiting <br>
  Job id            Name             User              Time Use S Queue <br>
  12345            jobName           brent             00:00    R Q1 <br>
</div>

<p>
  which may look like a small change, but is actually exactly what I was looking for
  since I often have many hundreds or thousands of jobs in the queue and only want to see
  the oldest ones, which are actually running and end up at the top. Now when I pipe the
  output of the script into <code>head</code> I can see the summary, as well as the jobs
  most likely to finish soon.
</p>

<p>
  The last part of the <code>tee</code> command is
  probably embarassing for me.  My understanding of <code>tee</code>
  made me think I could substitute one of the <code>head</code>
  or <code>tail</code> commands and just pipe into the other like
  normal:
</p>

<div class=code>
  | tee >( head -n -3 ) | tail -n 3
</div>

<p>
  Unfortunately, I have not been able to get the same output this way,
  and that also leaves me with some weird behavior that I managed to
  avoid by directing the "rest" to /dev/null. So if you know what I am
  doing wrong, feel free to shoot me an email!
</p>

<h3 class=sub>Footnotes</h3>

<p>
  *As I now know, you could save the output to an array in AWK and
  loop through the array to print the lines at the end.
