<p>I saw a comment on HackerNews (HN) today that claimed “[g]reen leafy
vegetables also [have] a lot protein (Kale, Broccoli and Brussels).” In
the context of the thread, I didn’t feel like it was really appropriate
to point out that this is not really the case, but for my own curiosity
I did look up some numbers and felt they were worth recording
somewhere:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Food</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">Protein</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Kale (raw)</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">4.3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Broccoli</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">2.8</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Brussels</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Eggs</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">12.6</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Chicken</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">24.7</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Lentils</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">9.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All of the protein values are from Wikipedia and in units of grams of
protein per 100 grams of the food. Each food but the Brussels sprouts
had a nice nutrition info panel with precise protein values, but the
sprouts only said “3% protein.”</p>
<p>As you can see from the table, leafy greens are emphatically
<em>not</em> a good source of protein. As a “bodybuilder”<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>,
I’m probably a bit biased in that I (usually unsuccessfully to be
honest) try to eat ~1 g of protein per pound of bodyweight, ideally in
four ~50 g of protein meals per day. To achieve that goal for a single
meal would require me to eat more than a kilogram of raw kale. The
protein value for cooked kale is even lower at 1.9 g per 100 g. In
contrast, I could eat 200 g of chicken or ~8 eggs (using 50 g as the
size of a large egg according to Google). The HN poster also mentioned
lentils and other legumes first, which are a more reasonable source of
protein if you want to avoid animal proteins. However, another food I
consider to have negligible protein, one slice of Wonder bread (28.5 g)
contains 2.5 g of protein for a whopping 8.8 g of protein per 100 g. So
you could eat 3.5 slices of white bread and get as much protein as 100 g
of lentils.</p>
<p>Obviously there are other dietary considerations than just the amount
of protein per gram of food, but it was a good excuse to find a few hard
numbers to check the claim on HN.</p>
