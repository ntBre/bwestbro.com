I saw a comment on HackerNews (HN) today that claimed "[g]reen leafy vegetables
also [have] a lot protein (Kale, Broccoli and Brussels)." In the context of the
thread, I didn't feel like it was really appropriate to point out that this is
not really the case, but for my own curiosity I did look up some numbers and
felt they were worth recording somewhere:

| Food       | Protein |
|:-----------|--------:|
| Kale (raw) |     4.3 |
| Broccoli   |     2.8 |
| Brussels   |       3 |
| Eggs       |    12.6 |
| Chicken    |    24.7 |
| Lentils    |     9.0 |

All of the protein values are from Wikipedia and in units of grams of protein
per 100 grams of the food. Each food but the Brussels sprouts had a nice
nutrition info panel with precise protein values, but the sprouts only said "3%
protein."

As you can see from the table, leafy greens are emphatically *not* a good source
of protein. As a "bodybuilder"[^1], I'm probably a bit biased in that I (usually
unsuccessfully to be honest) try to eat ~1 g of protein per pound of bodyweight,
ideally in four ~50 g of protein meals per day. To achieve that goal for a
single meal would require me to eat more than a kilogram of raw kale. The
protein value for cooked kale is even lower at 1.9 g per 100 g. In contrast, I
could eat 200 g of chicken or ~8 eggs (using 50 g as the size of a large egg
according to Google). The HN poster also mentioned lentils and other legumes
first, which are a more reasonable source of protein if you want to avoid animal
proteins. However, another food I consider to have negligible protein, one slice
of Wonder bread (28.5 g) contains 2.5 g of protein for a whopping 8.8 g of
protein per 100 g. So you could eat 3.5 slices of white bread and get as much
protein as 100 g of lentils.

Obviously there are other dietary considerations than just the amount of protein
per gram of food, but it was a good excuse to find a few hard numbers to check
the claim on HN.

[^1]: I definitely hesitate to call myself this. I've been lifting weights very
    consistently for more than two years now, but I am not very lean at all, and
    I have no plans to compete in bodybuilding competitions. However, my
    training is primarily focused on hypertrophy, so I think this is the best
    description, at least in a single word.
